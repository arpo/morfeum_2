# Morfeum Project Brief

## Project Overview
Morfeum is a React/TypeScript monorepo application designed to demonstrate modern development patterns and architectural best practices.

## Core Requirements
- Strict separation of concerns (markup, logic, styles)
- Component-based architecture with size limits
- Design system with tokens and centralized icon management
- Zustand for state management
- Monorepo structure with frontend and backend

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: React 18, TypeScript, Vite
- State Management: Zustand
- Styling: CSS Modules with design tokens
- Icons: Tabler Icons (centralized)
- Backend: Node.js/TypeScript
- Build Tool: Vite

## Architectural Principles
1. **Strict Separation**: Never mix concerns in single files
2. **Component Limits**: 50-300 lines per file
3. **Design System**: Centralized tokens and components
4. **State Management**: Zustand slices with clear boundaries

## Project Goals
- Establish maintainable codebase patterns
- Demonstrate scalable React architecture
- Provide foundation for feature development
- Enforce consistent development practices

## Current Status
Project is being adapted to follow SETUP_GUIDE.md patterns for optimal maintainability and developer experience.
