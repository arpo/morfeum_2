# Project Progress

## What Works âœ…

### Frontend
- **Project Structure**: Complete monorepo setup following SETUP_GUIDE.md
- **Design System**: Comprehensive design tokens and CSS custom properties
- **Component Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns implemented
- **UI Components**: Complete set of reusable components (Button, Card, LoadingSpinner, Message)
- **Icon Management**: Optimized centralized icon system with only used exports
- **State Management**: Zustand store structure ready for expansion
- **Build System**: Vite configuration with path aliases
- **TypeScript**: Proper type definitions throughout
- **Code Quality**: All components follow 50-300 line limits and architectural rules
- **Bundle Optimization**: Reduced bundle size with tree-shaking and unused export elimination

### Backend
- **Modular Architecture**: Domain-driven design with 12 focused modules
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configs (dev/prod/test)
- **Middleware Stack**: CORS, error handling, async wrappers
- **Route Organization**: API and health endpoints with clear separation
- **Service Layer**: Static file serving and business logic separation
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with zero build errors
- **Error Handling**: Custom error classes with proper logging
- **API Endpoints**: /api, /api/info, /api/test (MZOO proxy), /health, /health/detailed
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced health checks with system metrics
- **File Size Compliance**: All modules follow 50-300 line guidelines
- **Environment Variables**: Dotenv integration for secure configuration
- **External API Integration**: MZOO database proxy with API key security

## What's Left to Build ðŸš§
- Additional UI components (Input, Modal, etc.)
- Feature-specific components beyond the App component
- Zustand slices for specific application state
- Routing setup with react-router-dom
- Error boundaries and enhanced loading states
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Additional MZOO API endpoints integration

## Current Status
**Phase 1 Complete**: Core architecture and patterns established
**Phase 2 Complete**: Component refactoring and optimization finished
**Phase 3 Complete**: Backend refactoring and modular architecture implemented
**Phase 4 Complete**: MZOO database integration with secure proxy pattern
**Next Phase**: Build out additional features and API integrations

## Known Issues
- None - all TypeScript and build issues resolved

## Technical Debt
- Eliminated through refactoring - architecture enforces clean patterns
- All components follow size limits (50-300 lines)
- No mixing of concerns in any file
- Consistent naming and file organization
- Legacy styles removed and migrated to design tokens

## Performance Considerations
- Bundle size optimized: CSS reduced from 5.09 kB to 4.96 kB
- Icon exports optimized from 47 to 1 used icon
- CSS Modules prevent style conflicts
- Zustand provides efficient state management
- Component lazy loading can be added as needed

## Security Notes
- No known security issues
- Proper TypeScript usage prevents runtime errors
- CSP-friendly CSS Modules approach
- Clean dependency management with minimal unused imports

## Recent Refactoring Achievements

### MZOO Integration (Latest)
- **Backend Proxy**: Secure API proxy endpoint keeping API key server-side
- **Environment Configuration**: Dotenv integration for secure environment variable loading
- **Frontend Integration**: Automatic data fetching with proper state management
- **UI Display**: Clean presentation of MZOO data below headline
- **Security**: API keys never exposed to frontend, proper proxy pattern

### Backend Refactoring (Previous)
- **Modular Architecture**: Transformed 47-line monolith into 12 focused modules (532 lines)
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Implemented config/, middleware/, routes/, services/, types/, utils/
- **Type Safety**: Achieved 100% TypeScript coverage with zero build errors
- **Enhanced APIs**: Added /api/info, /health, /health/detailed endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Custom error classes with environment-specific responses

### Frontend Refactoring (Previous)
- **Legacy Style Cleanup**: Removed App.css, migrated index.css to design tokens
- **Component Extraction**: Created Card, LoadingSpinner, and Message reusable components
- **Icon Optimization**: Reduced icon exports by 98% (47 to 1)
- **Code Simplification**: Reduced total lines from 660 to 648 while adding functionality
- **Architecture Compliance**: All components strictly follow separation rules
