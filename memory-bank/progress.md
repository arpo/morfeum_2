# Project Progress

## What Works âœ…
- **Project Structure**: Complete monorepo setup following SETUP_GUIDE.md
- **Design System**: Comprehensive design tokens and CSS custom properties
- **Component Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns implemented
- **UI Components**: Button component with proper variants and loading states
- **Icon Management**: Centralized icon system with @/icons exports
- **State Management**: Zustand store structure ready for expansion
- **Build System**: Vite configuration with path aliases
- **TypeScript**: Proper type definitions throughout

## What's Left to Build ðŸš§
- Additional UI components (Input, Card, Modal, etc.)
- Feature-specific components beyond the App component
- Zustand slices for specific application state
- Routing setup with react-router-dom
- Error boundaries and loading states
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest
- ESLint configuration for code quality

## Current Status
**Phase 1 Complete**: Core architecture and patterns established
**Next Phase**: Build out additional features and components

## Known Issues
- None - all TypeScript and build issues resolved

## Technical Debt
- Minimal - the architecture enforces clean patterns
- All components follow size limits (50-300 lines)
- No mixing of concerns in any file
- Consistent naming and file organization

## Performance Considerations
- Bundle size optimized with proper imports
- CSS Modules prevent style conflicts
- Zustand provides efficient state management
- Component lazy loading can be added as needed

## Security Notes
- No known security issues
- Proper TypeScript usage prevents runtime errors
- CSP-friendly CSS Modules approach
