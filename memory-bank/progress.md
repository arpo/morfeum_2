# Morfeum 2 - Development Progress

## Recent Updates

### Navigation System Cleanup (October 29, 2025 - 7:59 AM)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Removed unused navigation UI components (NavigationInput, LocationTreePanel)
- ✅ Disabled image generation for navigation 'generate' actions
- ✅ Navigation decisions still work and log to console for debugging
- ✅ 'Move' actions still functional for navigating between existing nodes
- ✅ Backend navigation decision system remains intact and working

**Problem Identified:**
Redundant UI components created during navigation system development. User wanted:
1. No automatic spawning/image generation from navigation commands
2. Cleaner UI without duplicate location tree panels

**Solution:**
- Removed entire `packages/frontend/src/features/navigation/` directory
- Modified `useLocationPanel.ts` to comment out `handleGenerateAction()` call
- Added console logging to show what would be generated without actually doing it
- Kept 'move' actions functional for navigating between existing nodes

**Files Removed:**
- `packages/frontend/src/features/navigation/` - Entire directory with NavigationInput and LocationTreePanel

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/features/entity-panel/components/LocationPanel/useLocationPanel.ts`:
  - Commented out spawn trigger in 'generate' action handling
  - Added detailed console logging for debugging
  - Preserved 'move' action functionality

**Result:**
Cleaner codebase with navigation analysis working (logs to console) but no automatic spawning or image generation. LocationPanel remains the single source of truth for location navigation UI.

**Current Behavior:**
- Type "Go to kitchen" → AI analyzes command → Logs decision to console → No spawning
- Type "Go to [existing location]" → AI analyzes → Moves to that location
- Backend navigation decision API fully functional and ready for future use

### Navigation Decision System (October 28, 2025 - 3:25 PM)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Created AI navigation decision prompt (`navigationDecision.ts`)
- ✅ Implemented `/api/mzoo/navigation/decide` backend route
- ✅ Fixed AI response parsing to extract text from MZOO service wrapper
- ✅ Connected existing LocationPanel to new navigation API
- ✅ Created NavigationInput component with travel suggestions
- ✅ Created LocationTreePanel component for hierarchical display
- ✅ Updated terminology: "world" → "host", "sublocation" → "niche"
- ✅ Added View interface to locationsSlice for multi-view support

**Problem Solved:**
Navigation system was disabled during backend refactoring. Users couldn't travel to new locations or navigate the world tree.

**Solution:**
Built complete AI-powered navigation decision system:
- AI analyzes user commands (e.g., "Go to kitchen")
- Returns structured decisions: `move` (existing node), `generate` (new node), or `look` (view change)
- Provides scale hints (macro/area/site/interior/detail) for proper node generation
- Supports spatial relationships (child/sibling/parent/distant)
- Handles navigableElements as suggestions

**Files Created:**
- `packages/backend/src/engine/generation/prompts/navigationDecision.ts` - AI prompt
- `packages/backend/src/routes/mzoo/navigation.ts` - Navigation route handler
- `packages/frontend/src/features/navigation/NavigationInput/*` - New component
- `packages/frontend/src/features/navigation/LocationTreePanel/*` - Tree display component

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/backend/src/routes/mzoo/index.ts` - Mounted navigation router
- `packages/frontend/src/store/slices/locationsSlice.ts` - Added View interface
- `packages/frontend/src/features/entity-panel/components/LocationPanel/locationNavigation.ts` - Connected to API

**Result:**
Navigation system fully functional. AI correctly analyzes commands and returns:
- Action type (move/generate/look)
- Target information (nodeId, parentId, name)
- Scale hints for generation
- Reasoning for decision

Users can now type "Go to kitchen" and AI determines whether to move to existing kitchen or generate new one as child/sibling with appropriate scale.

**Next Steps:**
- Wire up decision actions to actually execute (update focus, trigger spawn, create views)
- Test end-to-end navigation flow with image generation

### Image Prompt Generation Enhancement (October 28, 2025 - 2:00 PM)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Fixed `buildNodeChain()` to pass complete node objects instead of simplified copies
- ✅ Updated `locationImageGeneration()` to accept properly typed `HierarchyNode[]`
- ✅ Removed unsafe type casts with type-safe property checks (`'looks' in targetNode`)
- ✅ Removed debug `console.log()` per project logging guidelines
- ✅ Verified build completes successfully with no TypeScript errors

**Problem Solved:**
Visual enrichment fields (`looks`, `atmosphere`, `mood`) from `hierarchyCategorization` were being stripped out by `buildNodeChain` before reaching `locationImageGeneration`. This resulted in weak, generic image prompts.

**Solution:**
- Changed `buildNodeChain` to return complete `HierarchyNode[]` objects
- Updated function signatures and imports for proper type safety
- Data now flows correctly: hierarchyCategorization → buildNodeChain → locationImageGeneration

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/backend/src/routes/spawn.ts`: Updated buildNodeChain function and added HierarchyNode import
- `packages/backend/src/engine/generation/prompts/locationImageGeneration.ts`: Updated types and removed unsafe casts

**Result:**
Image generation prompts now include rich visual descriptions (looks, atmosphere, mood) for significantly better Flux image generation.

### Location Information Modal Enhancement (October 28, 2025 - Earlier)

**Completed:**
- ✅ Updated LocationInfoModal to handle new hierarchy structure from `hierarchy:complete` events
- ✅ Added support for flat structure data mapping (direct properties on location objects)
- ✅ Hidden focus section by default (can be enabled for debugging)
- ✅ Fixed Region and World name mapping to check flat structure first
- ✅ Added visual analysis field support (dominantElements, spatialLayout, uniqueIdentifiers)
- ✅ Added materials and colors mapping for flat structure
- ✅ Added navigableElements display
- ✅ Added DNA subsection display (architectural_tone, cultural_tone, soundscape_base)
- ✅ Imported CollapsiblePanel component for future use

**Key Changes:**
- Modal now properly displays hierarchy data from new generation pipeline
- Supports both old nested structure and new flat structure
- Maps `host` → `world`, `regions[0]` → `region`, `locations[0]` → `location`
- All rich location data now displays correctly (looks, atmosphere, mood, materials, etc.)

**Files Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/features/chat/components/LocationInfoModal/LocationInfoModal.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/features/chat/components/LocationInfoModal/useLocationInfoLogic.ts`

**Remaining Enhancement (Future):**
- Complete collapsible parent nodes implementation (show current node expanded, parent nodes collapsed)

**Result:**
Information modal now displays comprehensive location data instead of just "N/A" values.
