# Project Progress

## What Works âœ…

### Frontend
- **Project Structure**: Complete monorepo setup following SETUP_GUIDE.md
- **Design System**: Comprehensive design tokens and CSS custom properties
- **Component Architecture**: Strict separation of concerns implemented
- **UI Components**: Complete set of reusable components (Button, Card, LoadingSpinner, Message)
- **Icon Management**: Optimized centralized icon system with only used exports
- **State Management**: Zustand store structure ready for expansion
- **Build System**: Vite configuration with path aliases
- **TypeScript**: Proper type definitions throughout
- **Code Quality**: All components follow 50-300 line limits and architectural rules
- **Bundle Optimization**: Reduced bundle size with tree-shaking and unused export elimination

### Backend
- **Modular Architecture**: Domain-driven design with 13 focused modules
- **Configuration Management**: Environment-specific configs (dev/prod/test)
- **Middleware Stack**: CORS, error handling, async wrappers
- **Route Organization**: Domain-based routing with clear separation (api.ts, mzoo.ts, health.ts)
- **Service Layer**: Static file serving and business logic separation
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with zero build errors
- **Error Handling**: Custom error classes with proper logging
- **API Endpoints**: 
  - Generic: /api, /api/info
  - MZOO AI: /api/mzoo/vision, /api/mzoo/gemini/text, /api/mzoo/fal-flux-srpo/generate
  - Entity Generation: /api/mzoo/entity/generate-seed, /api/mzoo/entity/generate-image, /api/mzoo/entity/analyze-image, /api/mzoo/entity/enrich-profile
  - Health: /health, /health/detailed
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced health checks with system metrics
- **File Size Compliance**: All routes follow 100-200 line guidelines (api.ts: 45, mzoo.ts: 196, health.ts: 54)
- **Environment Variables**: Dotenv integration for secure configuration
- **External API Integration**: MZOO AI services with secure proxy pattern
- **Centralized Prompts**: All AI prompts in packages/backend/src/prompts/ with type safety
- **JSON Parsing**: Reliable JSON extraction and parsing for all AI responses

### Entity Generation Pipeline
- **Progressive Loading**: Four-phase pipeline (Seed â†’ Image â†’ Visual Analysis â†’ Deep Profile)
- **Seed Generation**: Character data with name, looks, wearing, personality
- **Image Generation**: FAL Flux image generation from seed data
- **Visual Analysis**: Gemini Vision API analyzing generated images
- **Deep Profile**: Comprehensive character enrichment with 16 fields
- **JSON Parsing**: All AI responses use reliable JSON.parse() instead of regex
- **Frontend Logging**: Browser console debugging for seed, analysis, and profile data
- **Chat Integration**: Immediate chat initialization with seed data (progressive experience)

## What's Left to Build ðŸš§
- Additional UI components (Input, Modal, etc.)
- Feature-specific components beyond the App component
- Zustand slices for specific application state
- Routing setup with react-router-dom
- Error boundaries and enhanced loading states
- Testing infrastructure with Vitest
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Additional MZOO API endpoints integration

## Current Status
**Phase 1 Complete**: Core architecture and patterns established
**Phase 2 Complete**: Component refactoring and optimization finished
**Phase 3 Complete**: Backend refactoring and modular architecture implemented
**Phase 4 Complete**: MZOO database integration with secure proxy pattern
**Next Phase**: Build out additional features and API integrations

## Known Issues
- None - all TypeScript and build issues resolved

## Technical Debt
- Eliminated through refactoring - architecture enforces clean patterns
- All components follow size limits (50-300 lines)
- No mixing of concerns in any file
- Consistent naming and file organization
- Legacy styles removed and migrated to design tokens

## Performance Considerations
- Bundle size optimized: CSS reduced from 5.09 kB to 4.96 kB
- Icon exports optimized from 47 to 1 used icon
- CSS Modules prevent style conflicts
- Zustand provides efficient state management
- Component lazy loading can be added as needed

## Security Notes
- No known security issues
- Proper TypeScript usage prevents runtime errors
- CSP-friendly CSS Modules approach
- Clean dependency management with minimal unused imports

## Recent Refactoring Achievements

### Entity Generation JSON Parsing (Latest)
- **Deep Profile Conversion**: Switched from regex field markers to JSON format
- **Visual Analysis Enhancement**: Explicit JSON output instructions in prompts
- **Parsing Reliability**: All three AI operations (seed, vision, profile) use consistent JSON parsing
- **Console Logging**: Frontend browser console logging for debugging (no terminal spam)
- **Chat Timing Fix**: Chat initializes immediately with seed data, doesn't wait for deep profile
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages with raw response included for debugging
- **Prompt System**: Centralized prompts in packages/backend/src/prompts/ with type safety

### MZOO Routes Refactoring (Previous)
- **Route Organization**: Created dedicated mzoo.ts (196 lines) for all MZOO endpoints
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed test endpoint, reduced api.ts to 45 lines (generic routes only)
- **Vision API**: Added POST /api/mzoo/vision endpoint for image analysis
- **File Size Compliance**: All route files within 100-200 line backend limits
- **Domain Separation**: Clear separation between generic API (api.ts) and MZOO AI (mzoo.ts)
- **Three AI Endpoints**: Text generation (Gemini), vision analysis, image generation (FAL Flux)

### MZOO Integration (Previous)
- **Backend Proxy**: Secure API proxy endpoints keeping API key server-side
- **Environment Configuration**: Dotenv integration for secure environment variable loading
- **Frontend Integration**: Automatic data fetching with proper state management
- **UI Display**: Clean presentation of MZOO data below headline
- **Security**: API keys never exposed to frontend, proper proxy pattern

### Backend Refactoring (Previous)
- **Modular Architecture**: Transformed 47-line monolith into 12 focused modules (532 lines)
- **Domain-Driven Design**: Implemented config/, middleware/, routes/, services/, types/, utils/
- **Type Safety**: Achieved 100% TypeScript coverage with zero build errors
- **Enhanced APIs**: Added /api/info, /health, /health/detailed endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Custom error classes with environment-specific responses

### Frontend Refactoring (Previous)
- **Legacy Style Cleanup**: Removed App.css, migrated index.css to design tokens
- **Component Extraction**: Created Card, LoadingSpinner, and Message reusable components
- **Icon Optimization**: Reduced icon exports by 98% (47 to 1)
- **Code Simplification**: Reduced total lines from 660 to 648 while adding functionality
- **Architecture Compliance**: All components strictly follow separation rules
