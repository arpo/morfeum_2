# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Latest Session Summary (October 28, 2025 - 3:25 PM)

### Current Task: Navigation Decision System
Implemented AI-powered navigation system that analyzes user travel commands and routes to existing or new locations.

### Recently Completed Work

**Navigation Decision System (Complete):**
- ✅ Created `navigationDecision.ts` AI prompt for analyzing travel commands
- ✅ Built `/api/mzoo/navigation/decide` backend route
- ✅ Fixed AI response parsing to extract `text` field from MZOO service responses
- ✅ Connected existing LocationPanel travel input to new navigation API
- ✅ Created NavigationInput standalone component with suggestions
- ✅ Created LocationTreePanel component for hierarchical world tree display
- ✅ Updated terminology: "world" → "host", "sublocation" → "niche"
- ✅ Added View interface to locationsSlice for multi-view support
- ✅ System fully functional - AI correctly returns move/generate/look decisions

**Previous Sessions:**
- Image prompt enhancement (visual enrichment data flow fixed)
- Location information modal enhancement (new hierarchy structure support)

### Key Technical Decisions

**Navigation Decision Architecture:**
- AI analyzes user commands → returns `action` (move/generate/look) + context
- Three action types:
  - `move` - Navigate to existing node (provides targetNodeId)
  - `generate` - Create new node (provides parentNodeId, name, scale_hint)
  - `look` - Change viewpoint in current node (provides viewpoint, perspective)
- Scale hints: macro (host), area (region), site (location), interior (room), detail (niche)
- Response parsing handles MZOO service wrapper: `response.data.text` extraction

**Multi-View System Design:**
- Added `View` interface with perspective, viewpoint, distance, imagery
- Nodes can have multiple views (e.g., exterior view, interior view, window view)
- FocusState includes optional `currentViewId` to track active view
- Foundation for "look" actions that create new views

**Terminology Updates:**
- Internal types remain `'world'` and `'sublocation'` (avoid breaking changes)
- User-facing labels display "host" and "niche"
- AI prompt documentation uses new terminology
- LocationTreePanel UI shows updated labels

**Component Architecture:**
- NavigationInput: Travel command input with navigableElements suggestions
- LocationTreePanel: Hierarchical tree display with click navigation
- Existing LocationPanel: Connected to navigation API via `findDestination()`
- All follow strict separation: .tsx (markup), .ts (logic), .module.css (styles)

### Architecture Patterns Used
- Pure functions: locationImageGeneration receives complete data, no side effects
- Type safety: Proper TypeScript types eliminate unsafe casts
- Data preservation: Complete objects passed through pipeline without stripping fields
- Component separation: LocationInfoModal.tsx (JSX) + useLocationInfoLogic.ts (logic)
- Zustand store integration for focus state management

## Next Priority Items

### Immediate (Ready to Implement)
1. **Implement Navigation Actions**: Wire up move/generate/look actions to actually:
   - `move`: Update focus state to target node
   - `generate`: Trigger spawn pipeline with parent + scale_hint
   - `look`: Create new View and update focus to show it
2. **Test Navigation Flow**: Verify end-to-end navigation with image generation
3. **Integrate NavigationInput Component**: Add to main UI (optional, existing LocationPanel already works)

### Medium Priority
1. **View Management UI**: Display and switch between multiple views per node
2. **Navigation History**: Track and display navigation breadcrumbs
3. **Enhanced Tree Navigation**: Expand/collapse nodes, visual focus indicators
4. **Collapsible Parent Nodes**: Use CollapsiblePanel for hierarchy display

## Current System State

**Location Generation Pipeline:** ✅ Enhanced
- Hierarchy classification generates visual enrichment fields (looks, atmosphere, mood)
- Image prompt generation receives complete node data
- DNA generation and merging functional
- Visual analysis integration complete
- Focus tracking implemented

**Image Generation:** ✅ Enhanced
- Rich visual details now included in prompts
- Type-safe data flow from categorization to generation
- No data loss in buildNodeChain pipeline
- Cleaner code without debug logging

**UI Components:** ✅ Functional
- Information modal displays rich data
- Entity panels working correctly
- Navigation system operational
- CollapsiblePanel component ready for use

**Memory Management:** ✅ Updated
- Progress documentation current
- Active context tracking functional
- Project patterns documented

## Files Modified in Latest Session

**Backend:**
- `packages/backend/src/engine/generation/prompts/navigationDecision.ts`: Created AI navigation prompt
- `packages/backend/src/routes/mzoo/navigation.ts`: Created navigation route with decision logic
- `packages/backend/src/routes/mzoo/index.ts`: Mounted navigation router

**Frontend:**
- `packages/frontend/src/store/slices/locationsSlice.ts`: Added View interface and multi-view support
- `packages/frontend/src/features/entity-panel/components/LocationPanel/locationNavigation.ts`: Connected to new API
- `packages/frontend/src/features/navigation/NavigationInput/`: Created new component (markup, logic, styles)
- `packages/frontend/src/features/navigation/LocationTreePanel/`: Created new component with updated labels
- `packages/frontend/src/features/navigation/index.ts`: Exported navigation components

**Result:** Navigation system fully functional - AI correctly analyzes commands and returns structured decisions
