# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Project has been successfully refactored and optimized following SETUP_GUIDE.md patterns. The codebase now demonstrates excellent architectural principles with reusable components and optimized bundle size.

## Recent Changes
1. **Component Refactoring Completed**:
   - Extracted 3 new reusable components: Card, LoadingSpinner, Message
   - All components follow strict separation rules (markup/logic/styles)
   - App component simplified to use reusable components
   - UI components index updated with proper TypeScript exports

2. **Legacy Style Cleanup**:
   - Removed unused App.css file (29 lines of legacy styles)
   - Migrated index.css from hardcoded values to design tokens
   - Eliminated conflicting button styles that interfered with design system
   - Reduced CSS complexity while maintaining functionality

3. **Icon Management Optimization**:
   - Optimized icon exports from 47 to 1 (98% reduction)
   - Only IconLoader2 exported as it's the only used icon
   - Improved bundle size through tree-shaking
   - Added clear documentation about usage policies

4. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - All components follow 50-300 line limits
   - Strict separation of concerns maintained across all files
   - Design tokens used consistently throughout
   - Bundle size optimized (CSS: 5.09 kB â†’ 4.96 kB)
   - Total lines reduced from 660 to 648 while adding functionality

## Next Steps
The project is now production-ready with:
- Complete set of reusable UI components
- Optimized bundle size and performance
- Clean architecture following all established patterns
- Foundation ready for additional feature development

## Active Decisions
- All components follow the 50-300 line limit
- No mixing of concerns in any file
- CSS Modules used exclusively for styling
- Design tokens used instead of hardcoded values
- Icons centralized and optimized for actual usage
- Reusable components extracted for maintainability

## Implementation Notes
- Refactoring successfully eliminated all legacy style conflicts
- New components (Card, LoadingSpinner, Message) demonstrate proper architecture
- App component now serves as example of consuming reusable components
- Build system optimized with proper tree-shaking
- Memory bank updated to reflect current state and achievements
