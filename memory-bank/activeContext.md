# Active Context

## Current State (Nov 2025)
The Morfeum application is in active development with core systems operational.

### Recent Work Completed
- **Exterior Adaptation System** (Nov 13, 2025): Complete support for exterior niche generation
  - **2-Layer Architecture**: Foundation + Adaptation pattern for niche generation
    - Foundation (`nicheImagePrompt.ts`): Generic, DNA-driven base prompt (space-type neutral)
    - Adaptations: Structural rules that wrap the foundation (interior/exterior)
  - **Exterior Adaptation Created**: Open-air niche generation (`exterior.ts`)
    - Open-air space rules: sky visible, natural lighting, no ceiling
    - Exterior-specific prompt sections: parent analysis, transformation rules, composition
    - Horizontal expanse focus with sky in background
  - **Interior Adaptation Enhanced**: Explicit interior sections (`interior.ts`)
    - Enclosed space rules: ceiling enforced, interior lighting
    - Interior-specific sections: ceiling analysis, artificial lighting, vertical space
  - **Space-Type Aware System**: Fixed all hardcoded interior assumptions
    - `generalPromptFix`: Only applies ceiling rule for interior spaces
    - `promptSections.ts`: Separate functions for interior/exterior
    - `imageGeneration.ts`: Accepts spaceType parameter
    - `createLocationNodePipeline.ts`: Passes spaceType through generation chain
  - **Registry-Driven Selection**: Intent classifier reads registry dynamically
    - Exterior: "Open-air outdoor niches - sky visible, natural lighting"
    - Interior: "Enclosed interior spaces - DNA-driven style within structural rules"
  - **Result**: Can now properly generate both interior and exterior niches with correct lighting, ceiling rules, and spatial composition

- **LLM-Generated Names** (Nov 13, 2025): Automatic descriptive naming for niche nodes
  - **DNA Schema Enhanced**: Added `name` field to DNA generation
    - LLM generates concise, evocative names (2-5 words)
    - Avoids meta-words like "niche", "space", "area"
    - Uses articles like "The" when appropriate
  - **Pipeline Integration**: Extracts and uses LLM-generated names
    - Falls back to decision name if not provided
    - Logs source of name (LLM or fallback)
  - **Natural Place Names**: Generated names sound like real places
    - ✅ "The Sunlit Courtyard", "Garden Alcove", "Sculpture Plaza"
    - ❌ "Interior of X", "Exterior of X", "Minimalist Concrete Garden Niche"
  - **Result**: Every niche gets a unique, contextually appropriate name from the LLM

- **Complete "Go Inside" Pipeline** (Nov 12, 2025): Full end-to-end niche node creation
  - **Backend DNA Generation**: Creates complete node with LLM-generated DNA
    - Uses `nodeDNAGeneration.ts` prompt (same as location creation)
    - Extracts parent context (architectural_tone, cultural_tone, colors, mood)
    - Generates 19 DNA fields: looks, colorsAndLighting, atmosphere, materials, mood, sounds, etc.
    - Inherits parent styling for visual consistency
  - **Node Structure Creation**: Builds complete node with:
    - ID generation: `niche-${timestamp}-${randomString}`
    - Type: 'niche'
    - Name: From navigation decision
    - DNA: Generated by LLM
    - imagePath: FLUX image URL
    - focus: Interior perspective (perspective: 'interior', distance: 'close')
  - **Frontend Integration**: Automatic saving and tree management
    - Receives complete node from backend
    - Adds node to Zustand locations store
    - Adds to tree structure as child of current location
    - Auto-saves to backend (`temp-db/worlds.json`)
    - Switches view to new interior
  - **Complete Flow**: User types "enter" → Navigation analysis → FLUX image → DNA generation → Node creation → Frontend save
  - **Enhanced Logging**: Clear, well-formatted logs with visual separators and emojis for easy debugging
  - **Files Updated**:
    - `createNicheNodePipeline.ts` - Added DNA generation and node creation
    - `navigation.ts` - Returns complete node to frontend
    - `locationNavigation.ts` - Extracts node from API response
    - `useLocationPanel.ts` - Saves node and updates tree structure
  - **Result**: "Go inside" navigation now creates fully functional niche nodes with complete DNA and proper tree placement

- **Centralized Camera Configuration** (Nov 12, 2025): Unified camera system for smooth scene transitions
  - Created `shared/cameraConfig.ts` - single source of truth for all camera angles and lens specs
  - **Centered Composition**: Changed from asymmetric to centered, aligned camera positions
    - Exteriors: Camera faces entrance directly, centered composition
    - Interiors: Centered view into space from entrance
    - Smooth zoom-in transition: exterior entrance → interior space
  - **Structure-Aware Composition**: Added STRUCTURE FORM classification to visual analysis
    - VERTICAL STRUCTURE (towers): Prioritizes soaring ceiling, vertical shaft emphasis
    - HORIZONTAL STRUCTURE (halls): Prioritizes passage extending into distance
    - WIDE STRUCTURE (domes): Prioritizes circular expanse
  - **Lens Specifications**: Added to all location prompts
    - Overview: 16-35mm wide-angle
    - Exterior: 24-35mm wide-angle, centered on entrance
    - Interior: 14-35mm depending on space scale (small/medium/colossal)
  - **Files Updated**: 
    - `locationImageGeneration.ts` - now uses centralized config
    - `nodeImageGeneration.ts` - includes lens specs
    - `promptSections.ts` - centered composition, entrance exclusion
    - `locationVisualAnalysis.ts` - structure form field
  - **Result**: Consistent, aligned camera angles across all scenes for seamless transitions

- **Prompt Token Optimization** (Nov 11, 2025): Major token reduction across all LLM prompts
  - **Niche Image Prompt**: Reduced from ~1,800 to ~1,100-1,200 tokens (35-40% reduction)
    - Extracted all sections into reusable utility functions in `promptSections.ts`
    - Created condensed versions of 7 prompt sections
    - Added mode parameter ('detailed' | 'condensed', defaults to 'condensed')
    - File size reduced from ~180 to ~99 lines (45% code reduction)
    - All core instructions preserved, just more concise
  - **Intent Classifier Prompt**: Reduced from ~1,200 to ~650-700 tokens (45% reduction)
    - Created `buildCondensedPrompt()` helper function
    - Condensed intent definitions, smart selection rules, space classification
    - Reduced examples from 9 to 4 most critical ones
    - Defaults to condensed mode automatically
    - Using Gemini Flash Lite (fastest model available)
  - **Result**: Lower costs, faster responses, same accuracy

- **Parent Structure Analysis** (Nov 11, 2025): LLM-driven architectural form matching
  - Replaced brittle string matching with natural language analysis
  - LLM analyzes parent location's `looks` field to determine form
  - Extracts shape (circular, rectangular, cylindrical), ceiling type (domed, flat, vaulted), scale
  - Interior architecture automatically matches exterior form (e.g., circular building → circular floor plan + domed ceiling)
  - Handles edge cases naturally (e.g., "partially domed", "semi-circular")
  - No additional API calls - integrated into existing prompt

- **Smart Intent Classifier** (Nov 11, 2025): Intelligent element selection for navigation
  - Enhanced intent classifier to prioritize enterable structures over decorative elements
  - Added `uniqueIdentifiers` to context for better decision making
  - Navigable elements now include full details (type, description, position)
  - Prioritizes buildings/structures with windows/doors when entering locations
  - Avoids water features, vegetation, small objects as primary entry points
  - Handler updated to use `intent.target` from smart selection
  - Example: "enter" at resort now selects buildings instead of swimming pool

- **Niche Image Prompt Enhancement** (Nov 11, 2025): Significantly improved FLUX prompt generation
  - Added requirement for 3-4 specific, concrete navigation features (no vague descriptions)
  - Implemented mandatory foreground/midground/background composition layering
  - Added inline navigable element markers: `(navigable: type, position)` format
  - Markers placed at end of descriptions for natural flow
  - Will be extracted by LLM later (no regex parsing needed)
  - Ensures consistency between visual description and structured navigation data
  - Interior-only focus with architectural form matching (cylindrical, rectangular, dome, etc.)
  - Flexible `navigationFeatures` parameter for custom or default guidance

- **SSE Error Handling Fix** (Nov 7, 2025): Resolved unhandled error crashes
  - Added error handlers to SSE endpoint (`spawn.ts`)
  - Added error handlers to eventEmitter service
  - Prevents server crashes from client disconnections
  - Graceful cleanup of dead connections

- **Cascading Delete System** (Nov 7, 2025): Implemented proper cleanup when deleting nodes
  - Added `deleteNodeWithChildren()` method in locations store
  - Collects all descendant nodes recursively before deletion
  - Deletes from both location store and entity manager (tabs)
  - Cleans up pins for deleted nodes
  - Saves changes to backend automatically
  - Fixed orphaned tabs/nodes issue completely
  
- **Console Log Cleanup** (Nov 7, 2025): Removed spam logging
  - Cleaned 56+ console.log statements across 10 files
  - Kept only console.error/warn for actual issues
  - Professional, clean console output

- **Storage System**: Backend file storage operational (temp-db/)
  - Fixed backend path resolution issue (__dirname vs process.cwd())
  - Auto-save on all state mutations (pin/unpin/delete)
  - API endpoints: GET/POST/DELETE for `/api/worlds` and `/api/characters`

- **Memory Bank Optimization**: Reduced from 18,800 to 5,800 lines (69% reduction)
- **Terminology Standardization**: Changed "sublocation" → "niche" across entire codebase

### Core Systems Status
- **Character Generation**: New engine pipeline operational
- **Location Generation**: Hierarchy system with world/region/location/niche layers
- **Navigation System**: NavigatorAI for spatial movement (disabled generate action currently)
- **Tree-Based Architecture**: Nodes (flat storage) + World Trees (nested structure)
- **Event System**: SSE for real-time spawn updates

### Known Issues
1. **Navigation Generate Action**: Currently disabled in frontend
   - Backend supports niche generation
   - Frontend handleGenerateAction commented out
   - Ready to enable when needed

2. **Backend Route Naming**: Some compiled files still use old naming
   - Event names like `spawn:sublocation-*` in dist/ files
   - Source files are clean

### Architecture Decisions
- **Flat Storage + Tree References**: Nodes store DNA, trees store relationships
- **Cascaded DNA**: DNA inheritance through tree traversal
- **Component Separation**: Strict separation of markup (.tsx), logic (.ts), styles (.css)
- **Zustand Slices**: 50-150 lines per slice for maintainability

### Next Steps
- Enable navigation generate action in frontend
- Enhance saved entities browser functionality
- Add more navigation features (look around, change perspective)
- Add character-to-location chat switching
- Move from temp-db to real database (when ready)
