# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
MZOO database integration successfully implemented with secure backend proxy pattern. The app now automatically fetches and displays test data from the MZOO API on load, demonstrating proper API integration, environment variable handling, and data presentation.

## Recent Changes

### MZOO Integration (Latest)
1. **Backend Proxy Implementation**:
   - Added `/api/test` endpoint in `packages/backend/src/routes/api.ts`
   - Securely proxies MZOO API calls keeping API key server-side
   - Fetches test record from `https://www.mzoo.app/api/v1/data/test/1`
   - Returns structured JSON response with proper error handling

2. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Installed `dotenv` package for backend
   - Configured `server.ts` to load .env from root directory
   - MZOO_API_KEY now properly read from environment variables
   - Prevents API key exposure to frontend

3. **Frontend Data Fetching**:
   - Added test data state management in `useAppLogic.ts`
   - Implemented automatic data fetch on component mount with useEffect
   - Proper loading and error state handling
   - Updated TypeScript interfaces to include test data types

4. **UI Display**:
   - Test data displayed below "Morfeum" headline
   - Clean presentation of title and body content
   - Loading spinner during data fetch
   - Error message display on failure
   - Follows design system patterns with proper spacing

### Backend Refactoring (Previous)
1. **Modular Architecture Implemented**:
   - Transformed monolithic 47-line server.ts into 12 focused modules
   - Implemented domain-driven design with clear separation of concerns
   - Created config/, middleware/, routes/, services/, types/, and utils/ directories
   - All modules follow 50-300 line size guidelines

2. **Backend Patterns Established**:
   - Configuration as Code: Environment-specific configs with type safety
   - Service Layer Pattern: Separated business logic from infrastructure
   - Middleware Pattern: CORS, error handling, and async wrappers
   - Route Organization: Domain-specific routing with clear boundaries

3. **Enhanced API Functionality**:
   - Original `/api` endpoint maintained (returns plain text)
   - Added `/api/info` with comprehensive API documentation
   - Added `/health` and `/health/detailed` for monitoring
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging

4. **Type Safety and Quality**:
   - 100% TypeScript coverage across backend
   - Comprehensive interface definitions
   - Zero build errors
   - Proper error handling with custom error classes

### Frontend Refactoring (Earlier)
1. **Component Refactoring Completed**:
   - Extracted 3 new reusable components: Card, LoadingSpinner, Message
   - All components follow strict separation rules (markup/logic/styles)
   - App component simplified to use reusable components
   - UI components index updated with proper TypeScript exports

2. **Legacy Style Cleanup**:
   - Removed unused App.css file (29 lines of legacy styles)
   - Migrated index.css from hardcoded values to design tokens
   - Eliminated conflicting button styles that interfered with design system
   - Reduced CSS complexity while maintaining functionality

3. **Icon Management Optimization**:
   - Optimized icon exports from 47 to 1 (98% reduction)
   - Only IconLoader2 exported as it's the only used icon
   - Improved bundle size through tree-shaking
   - Added clear documentation about usage policies

4. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - All components follow 50-300 line limits
   - Strict separation of concerns maintained across all files
   - Design tokens used consistently throughout
   - Bundle size optimized (CSS: 5.09 kB â†’ 4.96 kB)
   - Total lines reduced from 660 to 648 while adding functionality

## Next Steps
The project demonstrates:
- Complete MZOO API integration with secure proxy pattern
- Automatic data fetching and display
- Environment variable management
- Complete set of reusable UI components
- Optimized bundle size and performance
- Clean architecture following all established patterns
- Foundation ready for additional feature development and API integrations

## Active Decisions
- All components follow the 50-300 line limit
- No mixing of concerns in any file
- CSS Modules used exclusively for styling
- Design tokens used instead of hardcoded values
- Icons centralized and optimized for actual usage
- Reusable components extracted for maintainability
- API keys kept server-side, never exposed to frontend
- Backend proxy pattern for secure external API access
- Environment variables loaded via dotenv in backend

## Implementation Notes
- MZOO integration demonstrates secure API proxy pattern
- Backend properly loads environment variables from root .env file
- Frontend automatically fetches data on mount with proper state management
- Data displayed cleanly without raw JSON dump
- Refactoring successfully eliminated all legacy style conflicts
- New components (Card, LoadingSpinner, Message) demonstrate proper architecture
- App component now serves as example of consuming reusable components and API data
- Build system optimized with proper tree-shaking
- Memory bank updated to reflect current state and achievements
