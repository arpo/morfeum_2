# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Project has been successfully adapted to follow SETUP_GUIDE.md patterns. The transformation is complete and the codebase now strictly follows the architectural principles outlined in the setup guide.

## Recent Changes
1. **Core Structure Created**:
   - .clinerules/ directory with zustand-slice-pattern.md and design-system-components.md
   - memory-bank/ directory with projectbrief.md
   - Updated package.json files to match setup guide requirements

2. **Design System Implemented**:
   - Design tokens (tokens.module.css) with comprehensive CSS custom properties
   - Centralized icon management system in @/icons
   - UI components structure with Button component following strict separation rules

3. **Component Architecture Refactored**:
   - App component completely refactored to follow strict separation rules
   - Created proper folder structure: features/app/components/App/
   - Separated concerns into distinct files:
     - App.tsx (pure JSX only)
     - useAppLogic.ts (pure logic only)
     - App.module.css (pure styles only)
     - types.ts (TypeScript interfaces)

4. **Configuration Updated**:
   - vite.config.ts updated with path alias for @/
   - Dependencies installed: react-router-dom, zustand, @tabler/icons-react
   - Zustand store structure established

## Next Steps
The project is now fully adapted to follow SETUP_GUIDE.md patterns. The codebase demonstrates:
- Strict separation of concerns
- Component size limits (50-300 lines)
- Design system with tokens
- Centralized icon management
- Zustand state management
- Proper TypeScript usage

## Active Decisions
- All components follow the 50-300 line limit
- No mixing of concerns in any file
- CSS Modules used exclusively for styling
- Design tokens used instead of hardcoded values
- Icons centralized and never imported directly

## Implementation Notes
- The original App.tsx violated multiple rules (mixed concerns in single file)
- New architecture completely separates markup, logic, and styling
- Button component serves as example of proper component structure
- Store is ready for slice expansion when needed
