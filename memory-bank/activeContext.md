# Active Context - Current Work Focus

## Latest Session Summary (October 29, 2025 - 7:59 AM)

### Current Task: Navigation System Cleanup
Removed redundant UI components and disabled auto-spawning from navigation commands.

### Recently Completed Work

**Navigation System Cleanup (Complete):**
- ✅ Removed unused navigation UI components (NavigationInput, LocationTreePanel)
- ✅ Disabled image generation for navigation 'generate' actions
- ✅ Navigation decisions still work and log to console for debugging
- ✅ 'Move' actions still functional for navigating between existing nodes
- ✅ Backend navigation decision system remains intact and working

**Previous Sessions:**
- Navigation Decision System (AI-powered navigation analysis)
- Image prompt enhancement (visual enrichment data flow fixed)
- Location information modal enhancement (new hierarchy structure support)

### Key Technical Decisions

**Navigation Decision Architecture:**
- AI analyzes user commands → returns `action` (move/generate/look) + context
- Three action types:
  - `move` - Navigate to existing node (provides targetNodeId)
  - `generate` - Create new node (provides parentNodeId, name, scale_hint)
  - `look` - Change viewpoint in current node (provides viewpoint, perspective)
- Scale hints: macro (host), area (region), site (location), interior (room), detail (niche)
- Response parsing handles MZOO service wrapper: `response.data.text` extraction

**Multi-View System Design:**
- Added `View` interface with perspective, viewpoint, distance, imagery
- Nodes can have multiple views (e.g., exterior view, interior view, window view)
- FocusState includes optional `currentViewId` to track active view
- Foundation for "look" actions that create new views

**Terminology Updates:**
- Internal types remain `'world'` and `'sublocation'` (avoid breaking changes)
- User-facing labels display "host" and "niche"
- AI prompt documentation uses new terminology
- LocationTreePanel UI shows updated labels

**Current Navigation Implementation:**
- LocationPanel only - single panel for location details and travel
- Travel input calls navigation decision API
- AI analyzes commands, returns decisions (logged to console)
- 'Move' actions navigate to existing nodes
- 'Generate' actions disabled (no spawning or image generation)
- Follows strict separation: .tsx (markup), .ts (logic), .module.css (styles)

### Architecture Patterns Used
- Pure functions: locationImageGeneration receives complete data, no side effects
- Type safety: Proper TypeScript types eliminate unsafe casts
- Data preservation: Complete objects passed through pipeline without stripping fields
- Component separation: LocationInfoModal.tsx (JSX) + useLocationInfoLogic.ts (logic)
- Zustand store integration for focus state management

## Next Priority Items

### Immediate (Ready to Implement)
1. **Re-enable Generate Actions**: When needed, uncomment `handleGenerateAction()` call in useLocationPanel.ts
2. **Implement 'Look' Actions**: Create new View when user wants different perspective
3. **Test Move Actions**: Verify navigation between existing nodes works correctly

### Medium Priority
1. **View Management UI**: Display and switch between multiple views per node
2. **Navigation History**: Track and display navigation breadcrumbs
3. **Enhanced Tree Navigation**: Consider if hierarchical tree view is needed (currently removed)
4. **Collapsible Parent Nodes**: Use CollapsiblePanel for hierarchy display if tree view returns

## Current System State

**Location Generation Pipeline:** ✅ Enhanced
- Hierarchy classification generates visual enrichment fields (looks, atmosphere, mood)
- Image prompt generation receives complete node data
- DNA generation and merging functional
- Visual analysis integration complete
- Focus tracking implemented

**Image Generation:** ✅ Enhanced
- Rich visual details now included in prompts
- Type-safe data flow from categorization to generation
- No data loss in buildNodeChain pipeline
- Cleaner code without debug logging

**UI Components:** ✅ Functional
- Information modal displays rich data
- Entity panels working correctly
- Navigation system operational
- CollapsiblePanel component ready for use

**Memory Management:** ✅ Updated
- Progress documentation current
- Active context tracking functional
- Project patterns documented

## Files Modified in Latest Session

**Removed:**
- `packages/frontend/src/features/navigation/` (entire directory) - Redundant UI components

**Modified:**
- `packages/frontend/src/features/entity-panel/components/LocationPanel/useLocationPanel.ts`: 
  - Commented out `handleGenerateAction()` call
  - Added console logging for what would be generated
  - 'Move' actions still functional

**Result:** 
- Navigation analysis works (logs decisions to console)
- No automatic spawning or image generation
- Cleaner codebase without redundant components
