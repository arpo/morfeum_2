Describe the camera’s stance — where it hides, how it leans, what it sees past or through. Favor elevated or oblique views over ground-level shots.

**Core:** framing + angle + composition + depth + near/mid/far tension  

**RULES:**
- No centered corridors or full symmetry  
- No horizon-line balance  
- No straight, low, or human-eye perspectives unless essential  

**Favor:** diagonal, off-axis composition • cropped edges • occlusion • layered depth • foreground anchors • parallax • subtle motion (smoke, mist, flicker)

**Camera Presence:**  
“elevated oblique view, partial structure cutting frame edge”  
“high side vantage, uneven sightline through haze”  
“aerial 45° tilt, diagonal layout breaking vanishing point”  

**Depth & Light:**  
“foreground obstruction from railings, shallow parallax through mist”  
“hard sidelight cutting through haze”  
“neon spill grazing wet pavement”  
“diffused dawn light mixing with sodium glow”

**Environmental Life:**  
“steam drifting from vents” • “wind shifting cables” • “rain streaking glass”  

**Lenses:**  
24mm f/2.8 — elevated wide, diagonal sweep, foreground intrusion  
35mm f/2 — oblique, partial occlusion, mid-depth  
85mm f/1.8 — telephoto compression, off-axis tilt  

**Scene Types:**  
Macro — diagonal detail, shallow focus, occlusion  
Interior — medium framing, elevated offset, cropped geometry  
Exterior — wide oblique, asymmetrical layout, parallax through haze  
Establishing — high vantage, tilted horizon, layered terrain  

**Examples:**  
“elevated side view through hanging cables, diagonal composition fading into haze”  
“aerial 45° off-axis frame, one edge cropped by rooftop structure”

Default to height, asymmetry, and depth over balance or symmetry.
Use light and environmental elements to add texture and life.
