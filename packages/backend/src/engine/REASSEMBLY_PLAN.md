# Engine Reassembly Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for refactoring the Morfeum world generation system. The old code in `services/spawn/` is being rebuilt incrementally in `engine/` with focus on prompt optimization and cleaner architecture.

## Strategy

1. **Disconnect UI** - Make buttons log only, no actual calls
2. **Rebuild piece by piece** - One pipeline stage at a time
3. **Test manually** - Verify each step works before moving on
4. **Optimize prompts** - Main goal is trimming unnecessary tokens
5. **Reconnect UI** - When engine is complete and tested

## Decisions Made

- âœ… **No unit tests** - Manual testing as we go
- âœ… **Tagged templates** - Type-safe prompts with variable interpolation
- âœ… **Keep locationsSlice** - Don't touch working storage system
- âœ… **Keep SSE** - Don't break event system
- âœ… **Focus on prompt optimization** - Trim verbose prompts, measure impact
