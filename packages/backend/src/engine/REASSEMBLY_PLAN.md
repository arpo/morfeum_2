# Engine Reassembly Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the step-by-step plan for refactoring the Morfeum world generation system. The old code in `services/spawn/` is being rebuilt incrementally in `engine/` with focus on prompt optimization and cleaner architecture.

## Strategy

1. **Disconnect UI** - Make buttons log only, no actual calls
2. **Rebuild piece by piece** - One pipeline stage at a time
3. **Test manually** - Verify each step works before moving on
4. **Optimize prompts** - Main goal is trimming unnecessary tokens
5. **Reconnect UI** - When engine is complete and tested

## Decisions Made

- ‚úÖ **No unit tests** - Manual testing as we go
- ‚úÖ **Tagged templates** - Type-safe prompts with variable interpolation
- ‚úÖ **Keep locationsSlice** - Don't touch working storage system
- ‚úÖ **Keep SSE** - Don't break event system
- ‚úÖ **Focus on prompt optimization** - Trim verbose prompts, measure impact

## Phase 0: Foundation ‚úì

**Status:** COMPLETE

**What was done:**
- [x] Created `engine/` folder structure
- [x] Created this reassembly plan
- [x] Added deprecation warnings to old code
- [x] Disconnected UI from backend
- [x] Tested disconnected UI still renders

## Phase 1: Utilities & Prompts ‚úì

   - Safe parsing with null fallback
   
2. [x] Type Definitions (`engine/types/`)
   - Core types: EntitySeed, VisualAnalysis, DeepProfile
   - ImageResult, PipelineTimings interfaces
   
3. [x] Tagged Template System (`engine/prompts/`)
   - Template builder with `buildPrompt()`, `estimateTokens()`, `logPrompt()`
   - Type-safe parameter validation
   - Ready for use

**Result:** Foundation utilities complete and tested

## Phase 2: Character Pipeline Migration ‚úì

**Status:** COMPLETE

**Goal:** Migrate complete character pipeline to new engine structure

**Completed Tasks:**
1. [x] Read all 4 existing character prompts from old system
2. [x] Migrated character prompts (ZERO content changes - exact copies):

   - `characterVisualAnalysis.ts` (52 lines) - Visual analysis
   - `characterDeepProfile.ts` (189 lines) - Deep profile enrichment
3. [x] Created `characterPipeline.ts` (235 lines) - Complete pipeline implementation
4. [x] Created barrel exports: `prompts/index.ts` and `generation/index.ts`
5. [x] Fixed all TypeScript errors (optional parameter handling)
6. [x] Verified TypeScript compilation successful with zero errors

**Files Created** (9 total):
```
