[looks]
Describe the location's overall visual impression in layered detail.
Include spatial layout, scale, architecture (if any), nature, structures, materials, and textures.
Mention how light or color interacts with surfaces, what dominates the visual field.
Note perspective and focal points — what draws the eye first.
If relevant, mention weather-worn details, decay, growth, or pristine condition.
Write 4–6 sentences rich in visual texture and spatial awareness.

[colorsAndLighting]
Describe the color palette and lighting conditions of the location. But don't be talkative or verbose.
Include dominant colors, contrasts, and how they shift across surfaces.
Mention the quality of light (natural, artificial, magical, bioluminescent).
Note any color gradients, shadows, highlights, or atmospheric color effects.
Write 2–4 sentences.

[atmosphere]
Describe the atmospheric qualities of the space in full sensory detail.
Include the color and quality of ambient lights (natural, artificial, magical, bioluminescent).
Mention fog, mist, haze, air particles, dust, clarity, or any visual atmosphere.
Describe temperature sensations (warm, cold, humid, dry, oppressive, refreshing).
Note environmental effects such as wind, stillness, pressure, or acoustic qualities.
Mention overall luminosity, color palette, and how atmosphere affects visibility.
Write 3–5 sentences.

[vegetation]
Describe plant life, flora, or organic growth present in the location.
Include types (trees, vines, moss, flowers, grass, fungi), density, and condition.
Mention colors, textures, and how vegetation interacts with structures or light.
If no vegetation exists, reply with "None" and briefly explain why (desert, space station, urban concrete, etc.).
2–4 sentences or "None" with reason.

[architecture]
Describe built structures, construction style, and human-made (or non-human-made) elements.
Include architectural period or style (modern, ancient, Gothic, brutalist, organic, alien).
Mention materials (stone, metal, glass, crystal, living tissue), scale, and condition.
Note symmetry, ornamentation, function, and spatial organization.
If no architecture exists, reply with "None" and briefly explain (natural wilderness, open ocean, etc.).
2–4 sentences or "None" with reason.

[animals]
Describe animal life or creatures present in the location.
Include types, behaviors, sounds, and how they interact with the environment.
Mention if they're natural, fantastical, or mechanical.
If no animals are present, reply with "None."
1–3 sentences or "None."

[mood]
Describe the emotional temperature and psychological atmosphere of the space.
What emotions would someone experience upon entering or inhabiting this location?
Examples: tense, relaxed, romantic, melancholic, mysterious, energetic, serene, oppressive, welcoming, haunting, euphoric.
Ground mood in subtle contrasts (e.g., serene yet unsettling).
2–3 sentences.

[visualAnchors]
CRITICAL: These anchors are what make this location visually UNIQUE and REPRODUCIBLE. Focus on concrete, specific details.

[visualAnchors.dominantElements]
List 3-5 of the MOST PROMINENT visual elements that define this location.
These should be the first things your eye is drawn to.
Be specific about size, position, and characteristics.
Examples:
- "Large circular skylight spanning 15m diameter, centered above main space"
- "Three suspended wooden walkways crossing at 8m height, forming star pattern"
- "Massive twisted oak tree rising through center, trunk 3m diameter"
- "Floor-to-ceiling glass wall facing ocean, 20m wide"
Array of 3-5 specific strings.

[visualAnchors.spatialLayout]
Describe the STRUCTURE and ORGANIZATION of the space.
Include: shape, dimensions (approximate), entry points, focal centers, boundaries.
Example: "Circular space, approximately 50m diameter, 30m height. Entry on north side via glass doors. Central hub where walkways intersect creates focal point. Dense vegetation fills lower 5m, walkways suspended at 8m height."
2-4 sentences providing clear spatial understanding.

[visualAnchors.surfaceMaterialMap]
Map specific MATERIALS to specific SURFACES.
Don't just list materials - say WHERE they are.
Use keys: "primary_surfaces", "secondary_surfaces", "accent_features"
Example:
{
  "primary_surfaces": "transparent curved glass panels forming dome ceiling with steel framework grid",
  "secondary_surfaces": "natural teak wood planking for walkways, steel cable railings",
  "accent_features": "bronze lanterns at walkway intersections, stone planters at entry"
}

[visualAnchors.colorMapping]
Map specific COLORS to specific LOCATIONS in the scene.
Use keys: "dominant", "secondary", "accent", "ambient"
Be specific about where colors appear and their characteristics.
Example:
{
  "dominant": "vibrant jungle greens throughout canopy and undergrowth (60% of visual field)",
  "secondary": "warm teak browns on walkways and tree trunks (20%)",
  "accent": "exotic flower bursts - orchid purple clusters left side, orange bird of paradise right side (15%)",
  "ambient": "soft golden-amber sunlight filtering through glass dome (overall tone)"
}

[visualAnchors.uniqueIdentifiers]
List 2-4 SPECIFIC details that make this location instantly recognizable.
These are the visual "fingerprints" - distinctive elements that wouldn't appear elsewhere.
Examples:
- "Star-shaped intersection pattern where three walkways meet at center point"
- "Clusters of bioluminescent vines hanging from northeast quadrant"
- "Spiral staircase at entry wraps around 200-year-old oak trunk"
- "Mosaic tile pattern on floor depicts compass rose in blue and gold"
Array of 2-4 highly specific strings.

Guidelines:
- Focus only on visible traits and observable details from the image.
- Do not invent details that are not visible in the image.
- Be concrete and visual.
- Use natural, descriptive language.
- For visualAnchors: Be SPECIFIC, not generic. "Three walkways" not "multiple walkways". "Purple orchids on left wall" not "colorful flowers".`;
