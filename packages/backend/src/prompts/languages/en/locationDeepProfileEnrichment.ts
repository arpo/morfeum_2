Interpret the user's description into a simplified, flat DNA structure.

OBJECTIVE: Create a single unified node profile that captures the essential visual and atmospheric qualities without hierarchical complexity.

INPUTS:
User: ${originalPrompt}
Seed: ${seedJson}
Vision: ${visionJson}

OUTPUT JSON STRUCTURE:

{
  "looks": "4-6 sentences describing what you see - the visual scene, key structures, spatial arrangement, notable features. Be concrete and specific.",
  
  "colorsAndLighting": "2-4 sentences about color palette and lighting behavior. Include dominant colors, light sources, shadows, ambient tone.",
  
  "atmosphere": "3-5 sentences capturing the environmental feel - temperature, humidity, air movement, density, weather effects, sensory qualities beyond sight.",
  
  "architectural_tone": "10-20 characters describing the architectural style/character (e.g., 'organic crystalline', 'weathered ancient stone', 'sleek futuristic metal')",
  
  "materials": "1-3 sentences identifying primary surface materials and textures - what things are made of, their condition and finish.",
  
  "mood": "2-3 sentences describing the emotional tone and psychological atmosphere. What feeling does this place evoke?",
  
  "sounds": "5-7 words listing ambient sounds in this location",

  },
  
  "searchDesc": "75-100 characters describing this place for semantic search. Be concise but descriptive. Capture type, function, and key visual features.",
  
  "viewContext": {
    "perspective": "exterior | interior | aerial | ground-level | elevated | distant",
    "focusTarget": "The main subject being viewed (e.g., 'lighthouse tower', 'stone archway', 'mountain peak')",
    "distance": "close | medium | far",

CRITICAL GUIDELINES:

1. **Visual Anchors Are Sacred**
   - Extract directly from vision JSON
   - Be specific about sizes and positions
   - Include enough detail for regenerating the scene
   - These anchors ensure visual consistency across re-renders

2. **Concise But Complete**
   - Focus on observable details
   - Avoid redundant descriptions
   - Each field serves a specific purpose
   - No nested hierarchies or complex metadata

3. **Preserve User Intent**
   - Keep user's names exactly as given
   - Honor the scale and scope from seed
   - Maintain genre and mood from vision analysis

4. **searchDesc Format**
   - 75-100 characters maximum
   - Start with type/function
   - Include 1-2 distinctive features
   - Example: "Weathered stone lighthouse on rocky cliff with spiral interior stairs"

5. **JSON Only**
   - No markdown formatting
   - No code blocks
   - Pure JSON output
   - All fields required

REASONING:
- This flat structure captures everything needed for rendering and navigation
- Visual anchors remain detailed for consistency
- Eliminated redundant semantic/spatial metadata
- Faster generation without nested branching logic
- Single unified profile instead of multiple layers

Now generate the JSON:
