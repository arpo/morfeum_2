    // World-level
    "A colossal floating continent drifting above endless storm clouds, its underside glowing with molten rivers of light.",

    "An endless desert world where crystal monoliths hum with ancient energy beneath twin suns.",

    "A city built within the ribcage of a long-dead leviathan, its streets winding between bone towers and coral-lit canals.",

    "A frozen ocean world where entire civilizations live inside translucent glaciers that pulse with bioluminescent veins.",

    "A vertical jungle world, layer upon layer of canopy stretching miles into the mist, filled with ruins and waterfalls.",

    "A lonely android sitting by a campfire under a shattered moon.",

    "A fractured floating marketplace orbiting a dying sun, where shattered domes of translucent glass drift slowly apart, connected by swaying bridges of vines and torn solar panels. Bioluminescent fungi cling to the steel ribs of the ruins, illuminating stalls still laden with petrified fruit and frozen fabrics that ripple as if moved by forgotten gravity. Below, the planet burns in slow motion, casting rhythmic pulses of amber light through the cracks in the hull. From here, you can see several paths — a collapsed corridor leading into the cargo bay, a shimmering lift-tube descending toward the engine sanctum, and a narrow walkway arcing across the void to another broken dome that flickers with residual power.",

    // Region-level (distinct biomes or districts)

    "The Ember District — a volcanic valley where lava flows serve as roads and iron bridges glow from the heat.",

    "The Glass Expanse — an endless salt flat shimmering like a mirror under a violet sky.",

    "The Nocturne Quarter — a twilight district of an eternal city, lit by floating lanterns and reflected neon.",

    "The Verdant Shroud — a dense forest surrounding ancient machinery, vines coiling through broken metal.",

    "The Azure Archipelago — hundreds of hovering islands linked by light bridges and waterfalls cascading into clouds.",

    // Location-level (specific sites)

    "A lighthouse built inside the hollow trunk of a petrified tree, its beacon spiraling upward through polished amber lenses.",

    "A grand plaza paved in obsidian glass, centered around a floating obelisk that rotates silently, aligning with unseen stars.",

    "An abandoned train station where ghostly carriages arrive without passengers, doors opening to empty light.",

    "A subterranean library carved from volcanic rock, its shelves glowing faintly from embedded crystals.",

    "A cliffside monastery clinging to wind-carved stone, its golden bells tolling in the fog.",

    // Sub-location-level (interiors or focused pockets)

    "Inside the lighthouse beacon room, glass shards hang in midair, refracting green light across ancient runes.",

    "Within the floating obelisk — a hollow chamber lined with mirrored metal and whispering constellations.",

    "The conductor’s cabin of the spectral train, filled with silver instruments that move on their own.",

    "The inner sanctum of the cliffside monastery, where candles float weightlessly around a suspended statue.",

    "Beneath the crystal library — a hidden archive submerged in warm, luminescent water.",
