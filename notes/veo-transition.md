cinematic dolly shot. The camera starts outside the structure in the first frame and moves forward in a single continuous motion toward and through the entrance — door, gate, or hatch — into the interior seen in the final frame. If the entrance is closed, it opens naturally as the camera approaches. No cuts, no cross-fade. Maintain smooth dolly movement and consistent parallax. Animate the environment with subtle life: ocean waves roll, trees and grass sway, dust or air particles drift in light. Don't add new characters, characters in image should be slightly animated. Exposure and color adapt realistically from exterior to interior lighting. The shot should feel physical, immersive, and seamless — one unbroken take moving from outside to inside.
