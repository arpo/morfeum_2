cinematic dolly shot. The camera starts outside the structure in the first frame and moves forward in a single continuous motion toward and through the entrance — door, gate, or hatch — into the interior seen in the final frame. If the entrance is closed, it opens naturally as the camera approaches. No cuts, no cross-fade. Maintain smooth dolly movement and consistent parallax. Exposure and color adapt realistically from exterior to interior lighting. The shot should feel physical, immersive, and seamless — one unbroken take moving from outside to inside.
