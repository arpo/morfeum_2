## For character images
6-second cinematic loop. Fixed camera, mid or close framing. The character feels alive — natural breathing, subtle eye blinks, slight shifts in posture or expression. Hair and clothing move gently, as if touched by faint ambient motion. Soft, realistic lighting with mild variation adds depth. Seamless, natural loop with a quiet sense of presence.

## Scenery images - character on the move
6-second cinematic shot. The camera moves forward or glides through the scene, creating a sense of journey or approach. The environment breathes — mist, dust, or light shifts subtly in the air. Any visible character moves naturally: walking, turning, or reacting to the space with believable weight and rhythm. Lighting evolves as the shot unfolds, heightening the feeling of anticipation and discovery.

## Scenery images - still
6-second cinematic loop. Fixed camera or very slow drift. The scene feels alive through subtle motion — mist curls, water ripples faintly. Leaves or dust move gently in the air. Depth and parallax create atmosphere, while the composition remains steady. Seamless, natural loop with balanced lighting and motion.

## Scenery images - more dramatic
6-second cinematic loop. Fixed camera with deep atmospheric perspective. The environment stirs — lights flare and fade, machinery hums, mist billows from hidden vents. Water ripples outward, reflections tremble, leaves or ash drift through the air. The scene feels as if it’s breathing — silent power returning, something vast reawakening beneath the surface. Seamless, dramatic loop with living detail and tension in the stillness.

## Scenery drone fly-throughs
6-second cinematic loop. Fast, smooth drone-style overflight across the landscape or structure. The camera glides forward with gentle tilt and roll, revealing depth and motion parallax. Wind stirs dust, mist, or foliage as the light shifts across surfaces. Movement feels intentional and fluid — no abrupt cuts, just a continuous surge through space. with a sense of energy and scale.

## Timelapse scenes
Cinematic 6-second video derived from a still image. Natural motion and atmospheric realism preferred.
Fixed or gently drifting camera capturing the passage of time — clouds race, light shifts from dawn to dusk, shadows stretch and fade. Subtle environmental motion: trees sway, waves pulse, mist gathers and dissolves. The world feels alive with accelerated rhythm yet remains smooth and natural, with balanced lighting and atmospheric depth.
